# Please note new linux-like numbering/naming conventions.  This version of 
# Orac is experimental and developmental.
#
# Please go back to Orac-1.0.z if you require a stable version for use with 
# Oracle.
#
# We are now using an x.y.z numbering system such that:
#
#    x is the major version number
#    y is the minor version number
#    z is the minor minor version number
#
# When 'y' is even, it is a stable release of Orac (eg: 1.0.0) and subsequent 
# 'z' patches should also be stable (eg: 1.0.1).  If you want a stable 
# product, please download these versions.
#
# When 'y' is odd, it is a development release of Orac (eg: 1.1.0) and 
# subsequent 'z' patches will also be developmental (eg: 1.1.999), and 
# therefore subject to rapid change & instability.  
#
# The Orac-1.1.z series is an attempt to amalgamate the use of other databases 
# in addition to Oracle.  
#
# Orac-1.1.0 is an EXTREMELY experimental attempt to give you Informix 
# functionality, and the ability to easily switch between these two different 
# databases, if you have both on your system.  Current Oracle-only users 
# should still have all their usual functionality, plus a bit more, such as 
# the new 'Explain Plan' tool.
#
# For new Informix people, please be patient if it doesn't offer all the 
# Informix functionality you desire.  We're working on it.  Let us know what
# you'd like (though we may already have plans for it, finding out it's a 
# definite 'must' can't do us any harm).  You should see what we'll be
# attempting to add soon, but you may often get a "Sorry, not implemented yet"
# message.
#
# This will improve as me move along, and if you have any comments to help us, 
# please let us have them.  Our Informix man is Kevin Brannen (email address 
# below) and if you have any Informix-specific questions, please let him have 
# them.  For Oracle specific questions, please select the best person from the 
# Orac Mongers below.  We will be attempting to introduce Sybase functionality
# within the next few Orac-1.1.z versions.  Please bear with us.
#
# The next stable version of Orac will be Orac-1.2.0, which we hope to release 
# before the end of summer, however,this is a very flexible date.
#
# However, as the Orac-1.1.z series progresses, it should hopefully gather 
# stability and functionality.  To try out all new Orac functionality, keep 
# coming back regularly, and downloading new developmental versions.  Living on
# the bleeding edge can be fun ;-)
#
# We plan to make releases every few days, if not sooner.

PREREQUISITES (For Oracle Users on Solaris):

   You'll need perl5.005_02 & 
   modules DBD-Oracle-0.54, DBI-1.02 & Tk402.004

LINUX USERS:

   There are some further notes at the end of this README file
   for Linux users.

WINDOWS NT USERS:

   There are some further notes at the end of this README file
   for Windows NT users.

REALLY QUICK START GUIDE:

   perl orac_dba.pl <RETURN>


SLIGHTLY LESS QUICK START GUIDE (based upon Oracle on Solaris):

*). Load perl5.005_02, DBD-Oracle-0.54, DBI-1.02 & Tk402.004
*). Unzip (gzip -d, gunzip) the Orac-x.y.z.tar.gz file
*). Untar (tar xvf) the Orac-x.y.z.tar file
*). cd Orac-x.y.z
*). Set ORACLE_HOME in your environment
*). Run orac_dba.pl, first making sure the top line of the
    file has the right Perl string address, eg:
        => #!/usr/local/bin/perl
    Or run it with the Perl program directly, 'perl orac_dba.pl'.
*). Most things should be fairly straightforward after that.


ABOUT Orac:

Preamble: This tool was originally developed on an Ultra-5 Sun Solaris 2.6 Sun 
workstation.  There may be incompatibilities on your workstation, which may 
need a little source code tinkering.  Our apologies.  Please mail us if this 
is the case.  Even better, email us the coded up solution :-)

Orac is named after the original Universal Computer, 'Orac' from Blakes' Seven. 
It is a Perl/Tk tool written in order to store many different and hopefully 
useful SQL scripts within one central easy-to-use interface repository.  
It is a Read-Only 'as is' GUI tool (ie: no DDL, DML, transactions, commits or 
rollbacks, only selects)* and will be updated continuously to improve its 
functionality and GUI-ness simplicity.  If you have any useful SQL scripts, 
which you would like to be included within Orac, or requirements which you 
think may be useful to others, please mail them to me and we'll try and embed 
them in the next release. 

If you read through the revision history below, you'll see many such ideas
have been taken up, and are now integral parts of the main Orac tool.

Simple graphical ideas for turning difficult-to-read database information 
into useful pictures are particularly welcomed, as is functionality 
not currently supplied within other GUI tools.  General ideas for improving 
Orac (which began life as a SQL script for killing rogue Oracle processes) 
are always welcomed.  

We hope you both enjoy using Orac, and save yourself some time by using it.

*Occasionally, this rule is bent a little to allow such tool extensions as
our 'Explain Plan' functionality for Oracle users.

FUTURE OF Orac:

We are aiming, within the next few versions, to move to a completely GPL
solution.  We also want to create a completely OS independent, database
independent tool.  If you'd like to help us do this, and/or join the 
Orac Mongers listing above, please let us know and we'll go from there.


REVISION HISTORY:
-----------------
Vers Date   Comment
---- ----   -------
0.01 Jan 99
0.02 Jan 99 Original code revised to make more stable on other platforms.  
            Removed all '-font' usage and wrapped some statements in 'eval' 
            statements to prevent premature shutdowns.  Also took all SQL 
            out of program and placed in flat files to be called 
            as-and-when necessary (also allows for easier SQL modification).
0.03 Feb 99 After further comments, radical revision carried out to
            shrink Orac into 1 Perl script, rather than numerous heavy
            modules.  Also revised Orac to use Tk4 partly to remove errors 
            for people using Tk4, and because the new 'Learning Perl/Tk' 
            manual recommends G. Sarathy's Win32 binary executable, which 
            currently uses Tk4.  Preparing code for first port away from 
            Solaris 2.6 UNIX.
            Thanks to Tim Bunce for constructive criticism.
0.04 Apr 99 Adjustments after first DBI-Users release.
0.05 Apr 99 More Adjustments after first DBI-Users release.
            Thanks in particular to Sean Hull for support.
0.06 Apr 99 Cleaned up a few extraneous debug statements.  Decided to not
            attempt ports, after hearing from some Linux users that
            Orac ran "out-of-the-box", also NT and my mind do not fit
            together.  Also, must add more functionality.
            Tasklist this time, resizing of windows should be better.
            Hit Ratios values should be clearer.  
            Thanks especially to Kevin Kitts.
0.07 May 99 More Buggette cleaning, and better screen resizing on Form.
            MTS support, under the Tuning button (thanks to Steve Shaw).
            Background colour option added (thanks to Honza Pazdziora)
            under File option.
            Language Independence added, edit the txt/language.txt file
            to change all Orac Menus, buttons etc, to your own text.
            New 'My Tools' menu Option created to add your own SQL 
            reports on-the-fly.
            (thanks to Jared Still for the inspiration on this one)
            Addition of 'User' field on main database connection
            screen to allow DBAs to use secure system-like users,
            with more security conscious permissions.
            (Thanks to Kevin Kitts for this one).
Orac-1.0.0  New numbering system.  This is a rename of ORAC-DBA-0.07, 
            and the latest 'stable' version for Oracle users.
Orac-1.1.0  First of new Developmental 1.1.z Series
            Finally got round to adding 'Interactive Form' for all
            the Oracle Views in the database, accessible by 'Object' menu.
            Added Orac icons for various iconizable windows.
            (Thanks to Edmund Mergl for sending us a coded patch).
            After an email from Kevin Brannen, and a fit of madness,
            decided to try and make Orac database independent.  Are
            we all mad?  Maybe, but it's fun, fun, fun in Orac City.
            (Thanks to Charles Wolfe for sending us some extremely
            valuable installation information.  He is a God-like
            Guru of a Class A1 nature)
            Thanks to Guy Harrison for allowing us to adapt his scripts
            from his excellent High-Performance Tuning manual.
            Many of these scripts have now been used in this version
            of Orac, and much more will be done later to improve our
            use of them.
            Added SQL Browser/Explain Plan for Oracle
            Better report formatting
            Current Oracle future plans include a 'dbish' window,
            Further non-Oracle database (particularly Informix) functionality,
            Eventual addition of Sybase functionality.
            More help files, comments in code,
            More modularity,
            +whatever else you'd like us to add?


EXTRA NOTES FOR LINUX USERS:

The following summarised notes have been taken from 
Kevin Kitts' Orac home page:

=> http://www.kkitts.com/orac-dba/

If you'd like any more detail, please go there first.

Requirements for Running Orac (under Linux)
-----------------------------------------------
perl 5.05 
Tk 800_014 perl module (www.cpan.org) 
DBI/DBD perl modules (www.hermetica.com) 
Orac Download the latest stable version (or
development version if looking for latest functionality)

Using Orac under Linux 
--------------------------
I've found a number of problems running Orac under RedHat 5.2. In order 
to get things to work it was necessary to get the latest *source* rpm for 
perl and rebuild perl. The man pages for rpm will explain how to do this 
rebuild - it is very straightforward. Also, the latest version of the 
perl Tk module (800_014) will be required as well. Lastly, you'll need 
to get the DBI/DBD modules and compile them. 

Make sure that you can get sql*plus to work first. If that works, make sure 
that the DBI/DBD make tests pass. If all of the above condtions hold true 
you should have no problem running Orac.


EXTRA NOTES FOR WINDOWS NT USERS:

Using Orac under Windows NT
-------------------------------
Environment required:

*. ActivePerl build 517
*. DBD-Oracle 0.61
*. DBI 1.09
*. Tk 800_011

The above environment was created under the following 
operating system conditions:

NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition (SP 3, no compiler)
---------------------------------------------
Nothing special is needed for the installation, 
which should run smoothly using these instructions:

*. Install the ActivePerl binary distribution 
from ActiveState.com

*. Then download and install the binaries for the 
various modules (Tk, DBI, DBD-Oracle, etc) 
from ActiveState's ftp site.

All the modules come with working install scripts, 
so installation is just a matter of running 
package manager script which comes with ActivePerl.

Then download Orac-1.0.z, install and run.

(The above instructions have also been tried on a 
Win98 box with complete success)

The ActiveState URLs are:

=> http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/
=> http://www.activestate.com/packages/zips/

You can download the latest Orac via:

=> http://www.kkitts.com/orac-dba/

We have altered the DBI->connect routine to try a couple
of different versions-on-a-theme, to allow non-unix
boxes to connect remotely.  If you still cannot connect
remotely, you may have to slightly change the DBI->connect
statements to give DBI the right configuration for your
remote database connection.
